Questions

Identify which sub-districts are having the highest and the lowest temperature and total precipitation.
```{r}
which()
```


Where are these districts located (east, west, north, south or central of the country)?

Are the values of total precipitation realistic, please make some literature review and/or check with available historical weather data.

Check the temporal variation of Dengue cases/deaths.
